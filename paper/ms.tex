In an axisymmetric potential the 6D phase space of stars' positions and
velocities can be reduced to a 3D space of invariant actions. For this reason
actions are commonly used to help interpret phase space. We show that if one
assumes the wrong galactocentric reference frame this can induce artificial
non-axisymmetries which manifest as time dependence in the computed actions.
However, the Milky Way is not axisymmetric in detail and so there are no
truly axisymmetric axes. We instead define the  ``optimally axisymmetric''
axes as the reference frame which minimizes the time dependence of the
actions. Using cosmological zoom-in simulations from FIRE-2, we show that the
optimally axisymmetric reference frame can differ from standard methods of
calculating the galactocentric reference frame by (some numbers). We further
show that if one uses the conventional method to define the Galactic midplane
in this simulated galaxy, the midplane can vary by nearly a scale height
across the galaxy. This work calls into question the use of actions as
dynamical invariants unless these reference frame issues can be resolved.

% However, it is not expected that actions are invariant in detail for the
% Milky Way. This in-invariance can come about from assuming the wrong
% Galactic potential, but it can also come about due to true
% non-axisymmetries. We show that actions can gain artificial time-dependence
% also by assuming the wrong reference frame. We argue that standard methods
% for determining the galactocentric reference frame are not gu

% it's spiral arms, bar(s), and gas clouds are all non-axisymmetric features
% that should induce long-term evolution in action space. However, these same
% features will cause a star's true orbit to deviate slightly from its orbit
% in an axisymmetric potential. If an observer assumes an axisymmetric
% potential when computing actions, this will induce an artificial short-term
% phase dependence of the actions, which we interpret as systematic error.
% Using the potential of cosmological zoom-in simulations of Milky Way mass
% galaxies from the FIRE collaboration (the Latte suite), we investigate the

\section{Introduction} \label{sec:intro}


Midplane resolved with $\sim 370$ to $570$ star particles.

We could have proceeded by taking an axisymmetric potential and adding
analytic spiral arms, a bar, and gas clouds. However, in preliminary work
with the FIRE galaxies we found that defining a consistent reference frame
between snapshots was very difficult. An inaccuracy in the direction of the
$z$-axis by a single degree induces a $140\,\pc$ change in the height of the
midplane at $8.2\,\kpc$. In a cosmological context it is not apparent that
there exists a consistent definition of the galactocentric frame, and we
therefore proceed in a cosmological context to include this effect.

We perform a set of three different simulations repeated for two of the Milky
Way zoom-ins, \mi and \mf.\footnote{The number corresponds to the mass of the
dark matter halo (here, $\sim 10^{12} \Msun$). The first ``m'' stands for
mass and the last letter is a unique identifier for the {\em initial
conditions}.} The first assumes an axisymmetric potential and also implicitly
a well-defined galactocentric frame. This first simulation shows that our
integration technique respects the fact that in an axisymmetric potential
actions are invariant and that our calculation of the actions does not
imprint some artificial phase dependence in the actions.


\section{Methods} \label{sec:methods}

\subsection{Simulated Galaxies} \label{ssec:fire}
We wish to perform N-body integration within a realistic Galactic potential.
In order to do this, we use the {\em Latte} suite of Milky Way-mass zoom-ins
from the Feedback in Realistic Environments (FIRE)
collaboration\footnote{\url{http://fire.northwestern.edu}}
\citep{2016ApJ...827L..23W,2018MNRAS.480..800H}. In a zoom-in cosmological
simulation a high resolution region of interest is embedded within a low
resolution cosmological context (\Gus{cites}). In the case of {\em Latte}, a
region that will evolve into a Milky Way-mass galaxy, identified in a
preliminary dark matter only run, is increased in resolution using MUSIC.
This allows one to achieve ultra-high resolution simulations of individual
galaxies than possible in a full cosmological run. 



Our centering differs from Sanderson et al. by $\sim3.2\,\pc$ for \mi.


\section{Optimally Axisymmetric Frame}
An analytic, axisymmetric potential with a known reference frame is a far too
simple description of the Milky Way. We thus turn to cosmological zoom-in
simulations as approximations to a ``true'' Milky Way potential. It is important to remember that 

\subsection{Cosmological Zoom-in} \label{ssec:cosmozoom}
Cosmological zoom-ins allow one to simulate a selected region at high resolution embedded in a low-resolution cosmological background \citep[e.g.][]{1993ApJ...412..455K,2014MNRAS.437.1894O}

\appendix \section{Pattern Speed} Our estimation of the pattern speed is very
crude, but throughout the text we have adopted three different speeds in
order to demonstrate that qualitatively our results do not depend on the
precise numerical value of the pattern speed. We identify the spiral arms by
first plotting a $\phi$-$R$ 2D histogram, shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:pattern_speed}. In order to compute $\phi$ and $R$, we use
the principal axes from \citep{2018arXiv180610564S}. Push push
