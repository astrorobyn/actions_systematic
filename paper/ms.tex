\begin{abstract}

We demonstrate the effect of midplane errors on the computation of stellar
actions. This error is induced by the fact that the local Galactic midplane
varies across the disk. As a result, when we make 6D phase space measurements
of stars that are non-local (i.e. far away), we are observing those stars with
a systematic offset in $z$. We show that this systematic offset induces time
evolution in the observed actions which we interpret as an error. We note that
this error is non-Gaussian and bimodal, with neither of the modes peaking on
the true action value. A midplane error of $\sim30\,\pc$ and $\sim225\,\pc$ is
necessary to induce a $100\,\%$ error in the vertical action $J_z$ for thin
and thick disk orbits, respectively. Using cosmological zoom-in simulations
from the FIRE collaboration, we show that the midplane can vary by
$\sim100\,\pc$ around the Solar circle, indicating that such an effect is
important for understanding the thin and thick disk. Our discussion is also
directly applicable to variations in the local standard of rest. The variation
of the midplane must be taken into account when performing dynamical modelling
across large regions of the disk accessible with the {\em Gaia} mission.

\section{Introduction} \label{sec:intro}
Our understanding of the Milky Way is currently undergoing a revolution in the
era of {\em Gaia} DR2. Recent major discoveries include the remnants of a
major merger \citep{2018Natur.563...85H}, a phase-space spiral (\Gus{cites})
indicating local substructure infall (\Gus{cites}), a gap indicative of a dark
matter subtructure in GD1 \citep{2018arXiv181103631B}, and \Gus{others}.

Underlying all of these discoveries is the assumption of a Galactocentric
coordinate system \citep{2008gady.book.....B}. In angular
coordinates, the center of the galaxy is taken to be the location of
Sgr~A\textsuperscript{*} \citep[e.g.][]{2004ApJ...616..872R}. From stellar
motions near Sgr~A\textsuperscript{*}, the distance to the center is taken to
be $\sim 8.1\text{--}8.3\,\kpc$
\citep{2009ApJ...692.1075G,2018AA...615L..15G}. The vertical height is found
by identifying where the stellar positions and velocities reach a maximum
(effectively the median height of all disk stars), and is usually taken to be
$\sim 25\,\pc$ \citep{2001ApJ...553..184C}, with more recent measurements from
{\em Gaia} DR2 placing it at $\sim 20\,\pc$ \citep{2019MNRAS.482.1417B}.

Once a Galactocentric coordinate system has been established and a 6D phase
space measurement of a star has been made, it is desirable to convert this
measurement into action space. Actions are quantities which describe the orbit
of a star and are conserved quantities under some assumptions which we
describe next. They are the typical integral of the Hamiltonian in cylindrical
coordinates and are given by,
\beq\label{eq:actions}
J_i \equiv
\frac{1}{2\pi} \oint_{\text{orbit}}p_i\,\text{d}x_i\text{,}
\eeq
where $i=R,z,\phi$.\footnote{We typically write $J_r$ instead of $J_R$ for
aesthetic reasons.} Note that $J_{\phi} \equiv L_z$. In a slowly-evolving
axisymmetric potential, the actions of stars' orbits are conserved quantities
\citep{2008gady.book.....B,2014RvMP...86....1S}. The non-axisymmetries of a
more realistic potential induce time evolution in the {\em measured} actions
--- the true orbital invariants (if they exist) are invariant by definition.

In a slowly-evolving, axisymmetric potential, the actions of each star are
time-invariant \citep{2008gady.book.....B}. In the Milky Way, stellar actions
are expected to evolve on short time scales due to scattering with gas clouds
and on long time scales due to resonances with spiral arms, bar(s), and other
large scale perturbations \citep{2014RvMP...86....1S}. For this reason, we and
other authors have used actions to study stellar scattering in the Milky Way
disk using the improved astrometry of {\em Gaia} DR2 and various age
catalogues \citep{2018ApJ...867...31B,2018arXiv180803278T}. Actions have also
been used to study different models of spiral structure in the Milky Way
\citep{2019MNRAS.tmp..155S}. A summary of the disk in action space is given by
\citet{2018arXiv180503653T}.

The transformation to action space is not trivial, and many of the assumptions
of the transformation are potentially incorrect. For instance, the assumption
that the Galactic potential is axisymmetric may be inadequate with current
measurement errors. Even if this assumption is valid, the parameters used in
our axisymmetric models may be inadequately tuned to observations. In
addition, the necessity of 6D phase space measurements of a star limits the
Galactic volume observable in action space.

With these limitations in mind, it is therefore natural to consider the reason
to transform to action space. One reason is dimensionality reduction --- in
the action space paradigm, a stellar orbit is completely described by three
actions, as opposed to six dimensions of phase space. This means that the
relationship between {\em orbital} properties of individual stars and stellar
properties such as age or metallicity can be investigated.

We explore one science goal that relies on the conservation of actions --- the
reconstruction of open clusters across large distances using dynamical
tagging. The basic program is to match stars with roughly the same actions as
their supposed natal cluster. To set the scene, we consider the orbits of the
nine open clusters within $250\,\pc$ as reported by the {\em Gaia}
collaboration \citep{2018AA...616A..10G}. In Table~\ref{tab:real_clusters},
we report the distance to each cluster, the three actions, and the maximum
vertical extent of their orbits ($z_{\text{max}}$). The actions are computed
using the technique described in Section~\ref{ssec:action_comp}.

We propose a new type of error in the computation of actions which has
implications for general dynamical modelling across the disk. Our main point
is that the ``local'' Galactic midplane is not the same as the ``global''
Galactic midplane. If we observe a group of stars that are
non-local\footnote{i.e. a group of stars that is far enough away. The exact
distance depends on the accuracy of the measurement being made and the goals
of the particular problem.}, they will know of a different local midplane than
our local midplane extrapolated onto their position. This means that when we
convert those star's positions and velocities from a heliocentric to a
Galactocentric coordinate system, we are inducing a systematic bias in those
stars' $z$ values. The same applies to inaccuracies in measurements of
$R_{\odot}$ and variations in the local standard of rest (LSR).

We do not propose what a modeller should use for the ``true'' global midplane,
since such a definition probably depends on the particular problem such a
modeller is facing. Even without a high-precision definition and measurement
of the global Galactic midplane, we can still assess how different we should
expect the local midplane to be by measuring the azimuthal dependence of the
local midplane. This procedure may be readily tractable over some of the disk
with current datasets, using appropriate selection functions. However, we turn
to simulation in this work because we can investigate the entire disk.
Specifically, we use cosmological zoom-ins of Milky Way-mass galaxies from the
Feedback in Realistic Environments (FIRE)
collaboration\footnote{\url{https://fire.northwestern.edu}} (the {\em Latte}
suite of simulations).

It is important for us to emphasize that when we state our local Galactic
midplane may be erroneous, we do not mean that past measurements/estimates of
it are wrong. Rather, what we mean is that it may vary from the local midplane
at other points in the Galaxy. In the face of {\em Gaia} DR2 (and soon DR3/4),
this may be an important effect to consider when performing dynamical
modelling across large distances.

In Section~\ref{sec:ref_frame}, we describe the general impact coordinate
system errors have on the measured actions. In Section~\ref{sec:local_fire},
we measure the local midplane in cosmological zoom-in simulations from the
FIRE collaboration. In Section~\ref{sec:discussion} we discuss and give some
context for our results, and implications for the definition of the Solar
neighborhood. We conclude in Section~\ref{sec:conclusion}.

\section{Motivation} \label{sec:ref_frame}
We first demonstrate the significance to action computations, especially for
disk-like orbits, of systematic errors in the determination of the Galactic
midplane and distance to the Galactic center. The consequences we explore here
may also arise from various other systematic errors. For instance, the
axisymmetric Galactic potential model used in many works to compute actions
may not be a good description of the true potential --- or the parameters used
may yield a potential that is systematically incorrect outside an original
fitted region. In this section, we assume that the Galaxy is perfectly
described by our model axisymmetric potential, and simply explore the
consequences of systematic errors in the determination of the Galactocentric
coordinate system.

\subsection{The effect of midplane determination on orbit and action
calculations} \label{ssec:cartoon} We present a cartoon in
Figure~\ref{fig:cartoon} to show how an inaccurate determination of the
midplane leads to a phase-dependence of the actions calculated from an orbit
specified by a phase-space point and an assumed potential model. The $y$-axis
corresponds to the vertical height of the orbit and the $x$-axis orbital
phase. The solid gray line indicates the ``true'' orbit of the star; that is,
its orbit as it oscillates around the true midplane. The dashed gray line is
an erroneous midplane assigned to the potential model which an observer uses
to integrate the orbit of the star and hence estimate its actions. The model
potential is otherwise identical to the one in which the star is actually
moving.

Now suppose this observer makes a measurement of the true orbit at the blue
point or the pink point (i.e. at two different orbital phases). Then the blue
and pink lines correspond to the orbits that the observer would compute for
each point based on the potential model with the erroneous midplane. In action
space, this would correspond to a different value of $J_z$ for the blue and
pink points. In this way, assuming the wrong coordinate system induces a
phase-dependence in the actions estimated for the star, which in the correct
potential (in this example, the one with the correct midplane) should be
phase-independent.

\begin{figure*}
\plotone{fig/cartoon.pdf}
\caption{Cartoon showing the effect an error in the determination of the
coordinate midplane can have on orbit integration and action estimation. The
$x$-axis shows the orbital phase and the $y$-axis the vertical height. The top
gray curve depicts an example ``true'' orbit oscillating about the true
midplane (horizontal solid gray line). Consider an observer who erroneously
assumes the midplane is located at the horizontal dashed line. Suppose this
observer measures the phase-space position of the star at two different
orbital phases (blue and pink points). If the observer were then to integrate
the star's orbit using a model potential with the erroneous midplane, they
would obtain the blue and pink curves for the star's orbit, respectively. The
actions estimated from these two  erroneous orbits would subsequently differ,
both from each other and from the actions estimated for the true orbit (in the
potential with the correct midplane). Hence an incorrect midplane in the
potential model assumed will induce phase-dependence in the actions estimated
for a given star in that potential.}
\label{fig:cartoon}
\end{figure*}

\subsection{Numerical methods} \label{ssec:action_comp}
We compute actions as in our previous work \citep{2018ApJ...867...31B}, using
the code \texttt{gala} v0.3 to perform orbit integrations and conversion to
action space \citep{2017JOSS....2..388P,Price-Whelan:2018}. To compute actions
we use the torus-mapping technique first presented by
\citet{1990MNRAS.244..634M} and adapted by \citet{2014MNRAS.441.3284S} to
calculate actions for an orbital time-series starting from a phase-space
position $(x, v)$ and integrated in a potential $\Phi$. We use the default
\texttt{MWPotential} as our potential, which is based on the Milky Way
potential available in \texttt{galpy} \citep{2015ApJS..216...29B}. This
potential includes a Hernquist bulge and nucleus \citep{1990ApJ...356..359H},
a Miyamoto-Nagai disk \citep{1975PASJ...27..533M}, and an NFW halo
\citep{1997ApJ...490..493N}, and is fit to empirically match some
observations. We use the Dormand-Prince 8(5,3) integration scheme
\citep{Dormand80:integrator} with a timestep of $1\,\Myr$ and integrate for
$5\,\Gyr$, corresponding to $\sim 20$ orbits for a Sun-like star.

Other methods for computing actions are used in the literature. For example,
the St\"ackel Fudge method \citep{2016MNRAS.457.2107S}, which uses a single
St\"ackel potential (with analytic actions) to approximate the Galactic
potential \citep{1985MNRAS.216..273D,2012MNRAS.426.1324B}, was used in many
recent works exploring actions in the Galactic disk
\citep[e.g.][]{2018arXiv180503653T,2018MNRAS.481.4093S,2018arXiv180803278T}.
For disk-like orbits, existing implementations of the St\"ackel Fudge method
are of acceptable accuracy, but since we also consider halo-like orbits in
this work we choose to use orbit integration and torus mapping throughout
\citep{2016MNRAS.457.2107S}.

\subsection{Quantification of the effect of systematic coordinate-system
errors} \label{ssec:quant} First, we illustrate the phase-dependence of an
example systematic error in the Galactocentric coordinate system. We will
consider three orbits in the model potential described in
Section~\ref{ssec:action_comp} that are typical of stars in the stellar thin
disk, stellar thick disk, and the stellar halo. We summarize their initial
positions in phase space and the actions computed by integrating their orbits
in the correct potential in Table~\ref{tab:orbits}. Each orbit, integrated
without systematic coordinate errors, is plotted in Appendix~\ref{app:orbits}.
We will refer to these orbits by their names (thin-disk, thick-disk, halo)
henceforth.

We begin by considering the thick-disk orbit. Suppose that we could observe
the thick-disk star's phase-space position at many different times (and hence
different orbital phases), but used a coordinate system in which the midplane
is systematically offset in height by $100\,\pc$ from its actual location ---
i.e. we subtract the vector $(0, 0, 100)\,\pc$ from each position in the
orbit. This corresponds to an observer physically located at the position $(8,
0, 0)\,\kpc$ in the coordinate system of the true potential, but erroneously
thinking they are located at $(8, 0, 0.1)\,\kpc$.

\begin{deluxetable*}{ccccccc}

\enddata
\end{deluxetable*}

Starting from each observation of the star's phase-space position that such an
(extremely long-lived) observer makes every $\Myr$, we then compute the
actions as outlined above using an integration from that starting point in
phase space carried out using the true potential (but specifying the star's
present-day position using the systematically offset coordinate system). The
erroneous computed actions for each phase-space starting point are shown for
the first $\Gyr$ of the orbit in the {\em upper} panels
Figure~\ref{fig:one_orbit_wrong_ref}.\footnote{Occasionally the numerical
scheme fails and very large actions are reported by \texttt{gala}---we perform
a $5\sigma$ clip on each action to exclude such orbits, but this only excludes
a total of $5$ orbits out of the $1000$ considered for
Figure~\ref{fig:one_orbit_wrong_ref}. Some numerical artifacts remain, but the
vast majority of orbits are computed properly.}
    
We also perform the same procedure but assume a $100\,\pc$ offset in the $x$
    component (i.e. subtracting the vector $(100, 0, 0)\,\pc$) in the {\em
    lower} panels. This is equivalent to a systematic offset in the
    determination of the distance from the Sun to the Galactic center.

Figure~\ref{fig:one_orbit_wrong_ref} shows that the actions computed in the
offset coordinate systems depend on the time (i.e. orbital phase) at which the
star's phase-space position is observed. (To our extremely long-lived observer
this would appear as time-dependence in the actions, which appear to oscillate
around their value using the correct coordinate system even though in this
example the Galaxy is described perfectly by a static, axisymmetric
potential.) The relative size of the phase variation in each action depends on
the direction of the systematic offset as well as the true values of the
actions (i.e. the type of orbit). In reality we will have one measurement of
the phase-space position to work with, in which case the determination of the
orbital phase in $z$ or $R$ is degenerate with the degree of systematic offset
in that coordinate (see Figure \ref{fig:cartoon}). Additionally, in searching
for migrated members of known open clusters, we would compute actions for
stars with a wide range of orbital phases and locations in the Galaxy. In the
following we therefore quote percentile ranges for the possible values
computed for each action as a proxy for the effect of these systematic errors
in the coordinate system.

For a systematic offset in $z$ ({\em upper} panels), the 95\textsuperscript{th} minus
5\textsuperscript{th} percentiles are $2.2$ and $6.2 \actunit$ for $J_r$ and
$J_z$, respectively. These are fractional errors of $5.7\%$ and $85.7\%$,
respectively. The error induced in $L_z$ is negligible, as expected since
$L_z$ is independent of $z$. It is worth pointing out that a
$100\,\pc$ error in an orbit with $z_{\text{max}}=850\,\pc$ --- a $12\%$ error
--- induced a $43\%$ error in the computation of $J_z$.

For a systematic offset in $x$ (or Galactic center distance), the
95\textsuperscript{th} minus 5\textsuperscript{th} percentiles are $6.9$, $47$,
and $0.71 \actunit$ for $J_r$, $L_z$ and $J_z$, respectively. These are
fractional errors of $21\%$, $3.1\%$ and $3.1\%$, respectively.

\begin{figure*}
\plotone{fig/schmactions_one_orbit.pdf}
\caption{The artificial phase-dependence in the observed actions induced by an
error in the Galactocentric coordinate system. We consider here the thick disk
orbit, which has actions of $(J_r, L_z, J_z) = (37.9, -1520, 7.0)\,\actunit$
and $z_{\text{max}}=850\,\pc$ (see Table~\ref{tab:orbits}). We integrate the
orbit according to the procedure laid out in Section~\ref{ssec:action_comp}.
Then, we subtract $100\,\pc$ from the $z$ value ({\em upper panels}) or the
$x$ value ({\em lower panels}) of each position in the orbit, corresponding to
an erroneous observer assuming a midplane ({\em upper}) or solar radius ({\em
lower}) that is off by $100\,\pc$. We then allow our (immortal) observer to
observe the orbit over $1\,\Gyr$ and perform the same orbit integration
procedure at each timestep, and report the values of the actions. The
computation of $L_z$ is pristine to errors in $z$, with only numerical
artifacts remaining. Only small errors are induced in $J_r$, with the middle
$90\%$ of values over the $\Gyr$ being within $\sim8\%$ of the true $J_r$. As
expected, large errors are induced in $J_z$ with a $100\,\pc$ offset in $z$,
with the middle $90\%$ of values being within $\sim43\%$ of the true $J_z$. The $x$
offset induces uncertainties in $J_r$ and $L_z$ of $\sim21\%$ and $\sim3\%$,
respectively. A $\sim3\%$ error in $J_z$ is also induced.}
\label{fig:one_orbit_wrong_ref}
\end{figure*}

We now repeat the same procedure for systematic offsets between $0$ and
$500\,\pc$ in the $z$ and $x$ components. In
Figure~\ref{fig:many_orbit_wrong_ref}, we report the 95\uth minus 5\uth
percentile divided by the true action value for the three different fiducial
orbits in Table \ref{tab:orbits}. The thick-disk (\thickcolor) orbit is the
one from Figure~\ref{fig:one_orbit_wrong_ref}, but we also now consider the
effect on the action determined for the thin-disk (\thincolor) and halo
(\halocolor) orbits.

The top row of Figure~\ref{fig:many_orbit_wrong_ref} shows the spread induced
in each action for an offset in the $z$ component (i.e. the Galactic
midplane). In the {\em bottom row} we consider offsets in the $x$ component
(i.e. the Solar radius). The {\em left}, {\em middle}, and {\em right} columns
show the fractional spread in the values computed for $J_z$, $L_z$, and $J_r$,
respectively. We compute the fractional spread $\Delta J_i/J_i$ as the 95\uth
minus 5\uth percentile of the action computed using the offset coordinate
system over the course of the first $\Gyr$, divided by the true action
(computed in the correct coordinate system).

In the {\em upper middle} panel, there is essentially no spread in the
determination of $L_z$. This is expected since, in principle, $L_z$ only
depends on the $x$- and $y$-components of the position and velocity of the
stars\footnote{In practice, however, $L_z$ is computed as part of the
torus-fitting method.}, and is thus unaffected by offsets in $z$. Indeed, the
result we found in Figure~\ref{fig:one_orbit_wrong_ref} for the thick-disk
orbit holds for all orbit types.
 
The {\em upper right} panel shows that the fractional error in $J_z$ is more
exaggerated for more planar (disk-like) orbits. For the thin-disk orbit, a
systematic offset of $\sim30\,\pc$ in the $z$ coordinate already results in
$100\%$ deviations in the actions. The required offset for $100\%$ deviation
is $\sim225\,\pc$ for the thick-disk orbit. The halo orbit is relatively
resistant to errors in the midplane, with only $\sim25\%$ error in $J_z$ out
to a midplane offset of $500\,\pc$.

For the offset in the Solar radius {\em bottom panels}, the error is largest
for $J_r$, with some deviations resulting in $L_z$ and relatively small
deviations in $J_z$. In the {\em bottom middle} and {\em bottom right} panels
all three lines nearly overlap.

In Figure~\ref{fig:Jz_hist} we plot a histogram of the observed values of
$J_z$ for the thick-disk orbit assuming a $z$ offset of $100\,\pc$ (i.e. the
{\em right} panel of Figure~\ref{fig:one_orbit_wrong_ref}). The true value of
$J_z$ is plotted as a vertical dashed line. Here we see that the spread in
$J_z$ induced by a systematic offset in $z$ is non-Gaussian and bimodal.
Furthermore, neither of the modes lie at the true value of $J_z$.

\section{Azimuthal midplane variations at the Solar Circle: estimates from
FIRE} \label{sec:local_fire}
\subsection{Description of Simulation} \label{ssec:cosmozoom}
Here we briefly describe the cosmological zoom-ins used in this work.
Cosmological zoom-ins allow one to simulate a selected region at high
resolution embedded in a low-resolution cosmological background
\citep[e.g.][]{1993ApJ...412..455K,2014MNRAS.437.1894O}. The FIRE
collaboration has simulated a number of Milky Way-mass zoom-ins as part of the
{\em Latte} suite of FIRE-2 simulations
\citep{2016ApJ...827L..23W,2018MNRAS.481.4133G}. We use the three zoom-ins
considered in \citet{2018arXiv180610564S} --- m12i, m12f, m12m, since they
have associated mock {\em Gaia} DR2 catalogues and the $z=0$ snapshots are
publicly available.

First, a dark matter only simulation was run with $\Lambda$CDM cosmology
parameterized by $\Omega_m = 0.272$, $\Omega_{\Lambda} = 0.728$, $\Omega_b =
0.0455$, $h = 0.702$, $\sigma_8 = 0.807$, and $n_s = 0.961$, consistent with
current constraints \citep{2018arXiv180706209P}. Halos are selected at $\z=0$
based solely on their mass ($\sim 1\text{--}2 \times 10^{12} \Msun$). In this
work, to avoid confusion with the vertical height $z$, we refer to
cosmological redshift as $\z$. Particles within $5 R_{200\text{m}}$ of each
halo are traced back to $\z=99$ and the initial conditions are regenerated at
higher resolution using MUSIC \citep{2011MNRAS.415.2101H}.

Simulations were run using
\texttt{GIZMO}\footnote{\url{http://www.tapir.caltech.edu/~phopkins/Site/GIZMO.html}}
\citep{2015MNRAS.450...53H}. Hydrodynamics is solved using the meshless
finite-mass method and gravity is solved using a modified version of the
Tree-PM solver of \texttt{GADGET-3}, using fully adaptive and fully
conservative gravitational force softening for gas.

These halos are uncontaminated and contain gas particles of mass $\sim 7000
\text{--} 20,000\,\Msun$ and star particles of mass $\sim 5000 \text{--} 7000\,
\Msun$\footnote{In fact, the simulation m12i contained a gas
splitting bug which causes a small number of gas and star particles to have
larger than typical masses. These constitute only $\sim0.2\%$ of the star
particles in the $z=0$ snapshots, and are only a factor of a few more massive
than typical star particles. Since our results are broadly consistent between
the three simulations, we ignore this minor complication.}, with the lower end
coming from stellar evolution \citep{2018arXiv180610564S}. Softening lengths
for dark matter and star particles are fixed at $112\,\pc$ and $11.2\,\pc$,
respectively.\footnote{This is $2.8$ times the often-quoted
Plummer-equivalent.} The gas softening length is adaptive, but at $z=0$ the
median softening length for gas particles around roughly solar positions (with
cylindrical radii within $500\,\pc$ of $8.2\,\kpc$ and $\abs{z}<1\,\kpc$) is
$98\,\pc$.

In this work, we take the coordinate systems used in
\citet{2018arXiv180610564S} as our fiducial coordinate systems for each
galaxy. The center of the galaxy is found through an iterative ``shrinking
spheres'' method, where the center is calculated for a given radius which is
then reduced by $50\%$ until converging on the galaxy's center. The center of
mass velocity is then determined by all star particles within $15\,\kpc$ of
this center. The galaxy is then rotated onto the principal axis frame as
determined by stars younger than $1\,\Gyr$ inside of the fiducial solar radius
$R_{\odot} = 8.2\,\kpc$.

It is important to remember that simulations of Milky Way-mass galaxies are
not perfect representations of the true Milky Way, as discussed in
\citet{2018arXiv180610564S}. For instance, the velocity structure of m12i is
closer to M31 than the Milky Way. However, in this work we are most interested
in the global properties of the m12i potential, and specifically in deviations
from axisymmetry. From this perspective, m12i is actually far more
axisymmetric than we might expect of the Milky Way. While m12i has prominent
spiral arms, it lacks a bar and a companion like the Large Magellanic Cloud.
In future work, these additional complications also need to be addressed.

\subsection{Local Midplane} \label{ssec:local_midplane}
We now turn to defining the local midplane that an observer might measure if
they were situated in each of these galaxies. We place our imaginary observer
at the solar radius of $8.2\,\kpc$ and azimuth $\phi$\footnote{Our erroneous,
immortal observer is also warp-drive capable.}, and consider stars within a
cylinder of radius $0.5\,\kpc$ and height $1\,\kpc$ perpendicular to the
fiducial disk.

This median height is taken to be what our observer would measure as the local
Galactic midplane at each $\phi$, and is reported for each galaxy in
Figure~\ref{fig:midplane}. We find that only $10$ iterations of this procedure
are necessary for convergence. We bootstrap resample $1000$ times and report
the $95^{\text{th}}$ minus $5^{\text{th}}$ percentile as the dashed-line error
bars. This bootstrap resampling is performed by first selecting all stars
within a height of $2\,\kpc$, resampling that selection, and then repeating
the $10$ iterations.

To allow for potential small inaccuracies in the fiducial coordinate systems,
we also subtract the best fit $\text{A} \sin{\left(\phi + \text{B}\right)} +
\text{C}$ curve from the midplane as a function of azimuth. For $\text{A}$ the
values are $-174$, $62$, and $3.8\,\pc$, for $\text{B}$ the values are $0.3$,
$0.65$, and $0.021\,\text{rad}$ and for $\text{C}$ the values are $-47$, $18$,
and $-15\,\pc$ for m12i, m12f, and m12m, respectively. For the assumed solar
radius of $8.2\,\kpc$, we can approximate the angle offset for the $z$-axis
from the values of $\text{A}$ --- we compute $1.22$, $0.43$, and $0.03\,\deg$
for m12i, m12f, and m12m. These angle offsets are consistent with the values
given in \citet{2018arXiv180610564S} for the difference between the $z$-axis
as defined by the gas and stars.

Figure~\ref{fig:midplane} shows the inferred midplane our imaginary observer
would make as a function of azimuth for each galaxy. The $90\%$ interquartile
range for each galaxy is $185$, $162$, $84\,\pc$ for m12i, m12f, and m12m. 

\begin{figure*}
\plotone{fig/midplane_fit.pdf}
\caption{The local midplane determined at the fiducial Solar radius
($8.2\,\kpc$) for the three FIRE galaxies m12i, m21f, and m12m ({\em left},
{\em center}, and {\em right} panels). The local midplane is determined at a
position $\phi$ by taking the median height of all stars within $R=0.5\,\kpc$
and $z=1\,\kpc$ (in cylindrical coordinates). The procedure is performed again
using the new height $10$ times to converge on the local midplane height. In
order to allow for the possibility that the fiducial Galactocentric coordinate
system is incorrect, we subtract the best fit $A\sin{(\phi+B)}+C$ curve from
each panel --- this figure is reproduced with the original midplane
determination (i.e. before subtracting the best fit sine curve) in
Appendix~\Gus{x}. We then bootstrap resample $1000$ times on all stars within
a $2\,\kpc$ height of the fiducial midplane to determine error bars (95\uth
and 5\uth percentiles), which we report as dashed lines.}
\label{fig:midplane}
\end{figure*}

\subsection{LSR Variations} \label{ssec:lsr_var}
For similar reasons to the midplane varying across the disk, we also expect
that the local standard of rest (LSR) is a function of azimuth as well. We
perform this calculation in Appendix~\ref{app:lsr}, but in order to perform a
best-fit subtraction as in the previous section is more involved, which we
delay to future work. We do note, however, that the variation in the LSR is
less pronounced than for the midplane, at least for how we calculate the LSR.

\section{Discussion} \label{sec:discussion}
We have shown that, in simulation, the ``local midplane'' can have strong
azimuthal dependence. The implications of this finding are not clear, but
clearly demonstrate that assuming our local midplane is the same as the global
midplane is insufficient for extracting the most dynamical information from
the {\em Gaia} mission. We focus our discussion now solely on the midplane.

\subsection{Applicability to the Milky Way} \label{ssec:is_it_real}
As we briefly discussed in Section~\ref{ssec:cosmozoom}, cosmological zoom-in
simulations of Milky Way-mass galaxies are not perfect representations of the
Milky Way, and do not reproduce every available observation of the Milky Way.
For instance, the velocity dispersion-age relation in m12i, m12f, and m12m is
closer to that of M31 \citep{2018arXiv180610564S}.

In order to assess the applicability of our work to the real Milky Way, we
consider a subset of Table~3 from \citet{2018arXiv180610564S} --- our
Table~\ref{tab:scale_height} shows the stellar scale heights of m12i, m12f,
and m12m and the current best estimates for the Milky Way. One noticeable
feature is that the FIRE galaxies are more ``puffy'' than the Milky Way.
\Gus{Maybe FIRE collaboration has some insight into the mechanism for this?}.
This would seem to suggest that the midplane estimates from
Figure~\ref{fig:midplane} over-estimate the true variation in the Milky Way.

\end{deluxetable}

Another important aspect to consider when comparing the simulated galaxies to
the Milky Way is the environment/merger history. For instance, m12i and m12m
both lack a massive neighbor analogous to the LMC. On the other hand, m12f has
had a recenter merger with \Gus{something}. \Gus{Expand more here - how to
incorporate merger trees?}

\subsection{Solar Neighborhood} \label{ssec:neighborhood}
To gain further handle on the midplane behavior as a function of azimuth, we
compute the range of midplane values for a given $\Delta \phi$ segment of the
midplane in Figure~\ref{fig:range_deltaphi}. With the observer's azimuth set
to zero, we consider a region extending from $-\Delta \phi/2$ to
$\Delta\phi/2$. We also compute the chord length for the chord extending from
the observer to $\pm \Delta\phi/2$. We repeat this for each of the $50$ bins
in azimuth. Each bin is plotted as a gray line, with the mean value in solid
blue and the $1\,\sigma$ dispersion as the dashed blue lines.

\begin{figure*}
\plotone{fig/fig_to_explain.pdf}
\caption{A cartoon explanation of Figure~\ref{fig:range_deltaphi}. An observer
is placed at the blue x in the plane of a backgrround galaxy (lime). For a
given $\Delta \phi$ (blue) centered on the observer, we record the range of
midplane values for this section of the Solar circle (orange). We plot the
value of the range against the value of $\Delta \phi$. We are also able to
convert the value of $\Delta \phi$ into a chord length (pink), which we plot
as a secondary, upper $x$-axis. We repeat the procedure for each initial
$\phi$ (gray lines), and also compute the mean and $\pm1\,\sigma$ values (dark
blue).}
\label{fig:fig_to_explain}
\end{figure*}

\begin{figure*}

\caption{The range of midplane heights encountered as a function of angular

angular width of $\Delta \phi$ centered on $\phi$ and report the range of
midplane heights within that width. We repeat the procedure for each $\phi$
and plot the result as translucent gray lines. We also plot the mean range as
a solid blue line and the $\pm1\sigma$ lines as dashed blue lines. The upper
$x$-axis shows the chord length from the position $\phi$ to $\pm\Delta\phi/2$.
A cartoon explanation of this Figure is given in
Figure~\ref{fig:fig_to_explain}.}
\label{fig:range_deltaphi}
\end{figure*}

A possible interpretation of our finding is that one should use a star's local
midplane in order to compute dynamical quantities like the vertical action.
Under the assumption that this interpretation is correct, we now consider the
implications for attempts to reconstruct disrupting open clusters by selecting
ejected members based on their actions.

Suppose an open cluster of mass $m_c$ on an orbit with actions $\bm{J}_c$ is
disrupted. We would like to determine all stars in the {\em Gaia}
dataset\footnote{This is likely to be more successful with DR3/4 than DR2,
since upcoming data releases will contain a far greater number of stars with
radial velocities --- though targeted, follow-up radial velocity surveys may
allow this program to be performed sooner.} that are likely to be ejected
members from that cluster. One could generate an initial catalogue of
candidate members by integrating the cluster's orbit and selecting stars close
to that orbit, accounting for the fact that the stream will not exactly follow
the orbit of the cluster \citep[e.g.][]{2011MNRAS.413.1852E}.

One could then make a further selection by requiring that the action of each
field star $i$ be close to the cluster's actions to within some bound, i.e.
$\bm{J}_i - \bm{J}_c \in V_e$ where $V_e$ is some volume in action space
enclosing a region of acceptable error. A natural choice for $V_e$ is to
center it at the origin and allow its extent to be the intrinsic action-space
dispersion of a disrupted cluster. This dispersion can be estimated as
\citep[Section~8.3.3][]{2008gady.book.....B}
\beq \label{eq:action_disp}
\frac{\Delta J_i}{J_i} \sim \left(\frac{m_c}{M}\right)^{1/3}\text{,}
\eeq
where $m_c$ is the mass of the cluster and $M$ is the mass enclosed by the
cluster's orbit. A more sophisticated treatment of the action-space dispersion
of disrupted clusters can be obtained by following
\citet{2011MNRAS.413.1852E}, but such a treatment is premature for this work.

The act of comparing a field star's action to a cluster's action (i.e. in
computing $\bm{J}_i - \bm{J}_c$) is subject to significant error if the
cluster and field star have significantly different local midplanes and an
observer assumed a single global midplane.

To explore the magnitude of this effect, we consider the following program.
First, we assume a cluster mass $m_c$ and estimate the expected action-space
dispersion from Equation~\ref{eq:action_disp}. We then consult
Figure~\ref{fig:many_orbit_wrong_ref} to determine the $z$ offset necessary in
order for the induced error in the vertical action to be the same as the
expected action-space dispersion. If this were the case, an observer would
have to account for the different midplane of the field star and the cluster.
We repeat this analysis for each of the three orbits considered in
Section~\ref{ssec:quant}.

With a characteristic $z$ offset in hand, we consult
Figure~\ref{fig:range_deltaphi} to convert this $z$ offset into a $\Delta
\phi$, which we convert to an arclength or characteristic distance (the
difference between the two will be negligible for the small $\Delta \phi$'s we
will compute). Therefore, if an observer is attempting to reconstruct a
cluster with a given mass on a given orbit, we will give a characteristic
distance between a field star and the cluster within which an observer might
not need to consider differences in their respective local midplanes.

\begin{figure}
\plotone{fig/cluster_offset.pdf}
\caption{The $z$ offset necessary in order for the action error induced by our
midplane effect to be comparable to the intrinsic action dispersion from a
cluster of mass $m_c$. We compute the intrinsic dispersion from
Equation~\ref{eq:action_disp} and convert the dispersion to a $z$ offset using
the result from Figure~\ref{fig:many_orbit_wrong_ref}. We consider the result
for the thin and thick orbit (Table~\ref{tab:orbits}). Nearby open clusters
(Table~\ref{tab:real_clusters}) have orbits closest to the thin orbit .}
\label{fig:cluster_offset}
\end{figure}

In Figure~\ref{fig:cluster_offset}, we show the $z$ offset necessary to induce
the action space dispersion computed from Equation~\ref{eq:action_disp}, using
the \texttt{gala} computed mass enclosed within a radius of $8.2\,\kpc$ ($\sim
10^{11}\,M_{\odot}$).

We now convert the $z$~offset-$m_c$ relation to an $R_{\n}$-$m_c$ relation,
where $R_{\n}$ indicates a sort of ``solar neighborhood'' radius. An observer
attempting to reconstruct an open cluster of mass $m_c$ with perfect knowledge
of the midplane at the location of the cluster would expect to find the
ejected members using a dynamical cut for field stars within a distance
$R_{\n}$ of the cluster. If such an observer wants to find ejected stars that
are at a distance greater than $R_{\n}$, a more sophisticated analysis would
be required, the details of which are not apparent to the authors of this
work.

We use the relation in Figure~\ref{fig:range_deltaphi}, which shows the
typical $z$ offset at each $\Delta \phi$, to convert a given $z$ offset into a
$\Delta\phi$, which we then convert into a chord length which we interpret as
$R_{\n}$, the neighborhood around the cluster. If the $z$~offset is greater
than the maximum range value of the galaxy, we simply report the maximum chord
length ($2\times8.2\,\kpc$). The result of this procedure is shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:Rn_mc}. The solid lines indicate the neighborhood values
assuming the mean relation between $z$~offset and $m_c$, and the dashed lines
show the $+1\,\sigma$ and $-1\,\sigma$ relations, indicative of the strong
$\phi$-dependence of the midplane effect.

Figure~\ref{fig:Rn_mc} is most informative for the thin orbit (\thincolor).
The neighborhood around $\sim100\Msun$ clusters can be as small as
$\sim300\,\pc$ but up to $\sim1.2\,\kpc$ for m12i and m12f, though the
situation is marginally better for m12m with values ranging from
$\sim0.8\,\kpc$ to $\sim3\,\kpc$. The neighborhood values steadily increase
with $m_c$, topping out at $\sim5\,\kpc$ for $\sim10^4\,\Msun$ clusters in
m12i and m12f. In m12m, the neighborhood value reaches the maximum allowed of
$16.4\,\kpc$ for clusters of mass $\sim800\,\Msun$. The interpretation of this
is that the expected action space dispersion is so high for such high mass
clusters that the measured $z$~offset is not large enough throughout the
entire galaxy to be important.

For the thick-disk orbit (brown), the neighborhood is at the maximum value for
nearly all masses, except at the very low-mass end in m12i.

\begin{figure*}
\plotone{fig/Rn_vs_mc.pdf}
\caption{The neighborhood around an open cluster of mass $m_c$ for the thin,
and thick orbits (\thincolor and \thickcolor, respectively; see
Table~\ref{tab:orbits}) and for each of the FIRE galaxies considered here ---
m12i, m12f, and m12m ({\em left}, {\em center}, and {\em right} panels,
respectively). Given the $z$ offset for a cluster of mass $m_c$ computed in
Figure~\ref{fig:cluster_offset}, we convert this to a chord length using the
result from Figure~\ref{fig:range_deltaphi}. We interpret this chord length as
the ``neighborhood'' around the cluster, i.e. the distance from the cluster
one could go before the $J_z$ error induced by our midplane effect is
comparable to the intrinsic action dispersion of the cluster. When the $z$
offset is larger than the maximum range in Figure~\ref{fig:range_deltaphi}, we
report the maximum chord length ($2\times8.2\,\kpc$). We aso report the same
procedure but using the $\pm1\sigma$ lines from
Figure~\ref{fig:range_deltaphi}, which we plot here as dashed lines. For the
thick orbit (\thickcolor), the neighborhood is quite large and thus the effect
is negligible. However, for the thin orbit (\thincolor), which is closest to
the orbits of nearby open clusters (see Table~\ref{tab:real_clusters}), the
neighborhood is only a few hundred $\pc$ for low-mass clusters.}
\label{fig:Rn_mc}
\end{figure*}

\section{Conclusions}\label{sec:conclusion}
Let's conclude, shall we.

\begin{itemize}
\item We demonstrated that an inaccuracy in the Galactocentric coordinate
system induces time evolution in the {\em observed} actions
(Figures~\ref{fig:cartoon}\&\ref{fig:one_orbit_wrong_ref}). 

\item We interpret this time evolution as an error in the computed action
(Figure~\ref{fig:many_orbit_wrong_ref}). We focused on the effect that an
inaccuracy in the midplane has on the vertical action $J_z$. We found that in
order for there to be a $100\%$ error in $J_z$ (as defined by the middle
$90\uth$ percentile) one needs a midplane error of $\sim30\,\pc$ and
$\sim225\,\pc$ for a typical thin and thick disk orbit, respectively. The
fractional error is significantly less for halo orbits.

\item We pointed out that the error distribution of the actions induced by a
coordinate system error is very non-Gaussian. The distribution is bimodal with
{\em neither of the modes peaking at the true value}. As a result, error
propagation is very involved when considering actions.

\item We proposed that dynamical modelling across large regions of the disk is
susceptible to this type of error, since the assumption that our local
Galactic midplane is the global Galactic midplane is not true {\em a priori}.

\item To demonstrate the previous point, we measured the local Galactic
midplane along the Solar circle in three different high-resolution, zoom-in
simulations of Milky Way mass galaxies from the FIRE collaboration. We found
that the midplane varies by $\sim185, 162, 84\,\pc$ (middle $90\%$) for the
three galaxies we considered (m12i, m12f, and m12m, respectively).

\end{itemize}

While in this work we have focused on errors in action computation, all of our
conclusions also extend to studies of stars that simply rely on orbit
integration, since the computation of actions and orbit integrations are
essentially equivalent.
