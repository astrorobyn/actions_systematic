\begin{abstract}

In a completely axisymmetric potential, the notion of a global Galactic
midplane is well defined. However, since the Milky Way is not completely
axisymmetric, the global Galactic midplane is to some level of precision not
well defined. The local Galactic midplane has been found by determining the
height at which the number counts of stars reaches a maximum. This local
midplane is then used as the global midplane, an assumption which would be
justified in a completely axisymmetric potential. Assuming a global Galactic
midplane exists, we show in three cosmological zoom-in simulations from the
FIRE collaboration that local determinations of the midplane can vary by up to
a thin disk scale height. The effect is more pronounced in galaxies with less
quiescent histories (e.g. Sagittarius-like encounters). We explore one
consequence of such an inaccuracy of the midplane in the context of orbital
actions. Using standard orbit integration techniques, we show that midplane
inaccuracy induces artifical time evolution in the vertical action that makes
it virtually unusable for individual stars in the disk. The situation is less
dire for angular momentum and radial action determinations, though we also
show that inaccuracies in the solar radius can have a similar effect on the
latter. As a result, we question the use of actions as dynamical invariants in
the Milky Way disk.

\section{Introduction} \label{sec:intro}
Our understanding of the Milky Way is currently undergoing a revolution in the
era of {\em Gaia} DR2. Recent major discoveries include the remnants of a
major merger \citep{2018Natur.563...85H}, a phase-space spiral (\Gus{cites})
indicating local substructure infall (\Gus{cites}), a gap indicative of a dark
matter subtructure in GD1 \citep{2018arXiv181103631B}, and \Gus{others}.

Underlying all of these discoveries is the assumption of a galactocentric
coordinate system \citep{2008gady.book.....B}. In angular
coordinates, the center of the galaxy is taken to be the location of
Sgr~A\textsuperscript{*} \citep[e.g.][]{2004ApJ...616..872R}. From stellar
motions near Sgr~A\textsuperscript{*}, the distance to the center is taken to
be $\sim 8.1\text{--}8.3\,\kpc$
\citep{2009ApJ...692.1075G,2018A&A...615L..15G}. The vertical height is found
by identifying where the stellar positions and velocities reach a maximum
(effectively the median height of all disk stars), and is usually taken to be
$\sim 25\,\pc$ \citep{2001ApJ...553..184C}, with more recent measurements from
{\em Gaia} DR2 placing it at $\sim 20\,\pc$ \citep{2019MNRAS.482.1417B}.

These measurements of the galactocentric coordinate system rely on the
assumption of an axisymmetric Milky Way. Under this assumption, these
estimates would provide the correct parameters for the galactocentric
coordinate system up to measurement error. However, the Milky Way is not
axisymmetric in detail. Spiral arms, bar(s), and infalling satellite galaxies
such as Sagittarius and the Large Magellanic Cloud all induce
non-axisymmetries.

Since the Milky Way is not truly axisymmetric, it is not clear the best way to
define the galactocentric coordinate system. In this work, we consider one
possible physically motivated approach to defining the galactocentric
coordinate system, and show that it can differ from conventional methods of
frame measurements.

In a slowly-evolving axisymmetric potential, the actions of stars' orbits are
conserved quantities \citep{2008gady.book.....B,2014RvMP...86....1S}. In other
words, if we could measure the actions of a star in such a potential, we would
measure the same actions over the course of the orbit. The non-axisymmetries
of a more realistic potential induce time evolution in the {\em measured}
actions --- the true orbital invariants (if they exist) are invariant by
definition. Through simple tests, we will see that even in a truly
axisymmetric potential, if the wrong coordinate system is assumed then there
will be additional time evolution in the measured actions.

To provide one such realization of a realistic Galactic potential, we turn to
cosmological zoom-ins of Milky Way-mass galaxies from the Feedback in
Realistic Environments (FIRE)
collaboration\footnote{\url{https://fire.northwestern.edu}} (the Latte suite
of simulations).

\section{Local Midplane in FIRE} \label{sec:local_fire}
\subsection{Description of Simulation} \label{ssec:cosmozoom}
Here we briefly describe the cosmological zoom-ins used in this work.
Cosmological zoom-ins allow one to simulate a selected region at high
resolution embedded in a low-resolution cosmological background
\citep[e.g.][]{1993ApJ...412..455K,2014MNRAS.437.1894O}. The FIRE
collaboration has simulated a number of Milky Way-mass zoom-ins as part of the
{\em Latte} suite of FIRE-2 simulations
\citep{2016ApJ...827L..23W,2018MNRAS.481.4133G}. We use the three zoom-ins
considered in \citet{2018arXiv180610564S} --- m12i, m12f, m12m, since they
have associated mock {\em Gaia} DR2 catalogues and the $z=0$ snapshots are
publicly available.

First, a dark matter only simulation was run with $\Lambda$CDM cosmology
parameterized by $\Omega_m = 0.272$, $\Omega_{\Lambda} = 0.728$, $\Omega_b =
0.0455$, $h = 0.702$, $\sigma_8 = 0.807$, and $n_s = 0.961$, consistent with
current constraints \citep{2018arXiv180706209P}. Halos are selected at $z=0$
based solely on their mass ($\sim 1\text{--}2 \times 10^{12} \Msun$).
Particles within $5 R_{200\text{m}}$ of each halo are traced back to $\z=99$
and the initial conditions are regenerated at higher resolution using MUSIC
\citep{2011MNRAS.415.2101H}.

Simulations were run using
\texttt{GIZMO}\footnote{\url{http://www.tapir.caltech.edu/~phopkins/Site/GIZMO.html}}
\citep{2015MNRAS.450...53H}. Hydrodynamics is solved using the meshless
finite-mass method and gravity is solved using a modified version of the
Tree-PM solver of \texttt{GADGET-3}, using fully adaptive and fully
conservative gravitational force softening for gas.

These halos are uncontaminated and contain gas particles of mass $\sim 7000
\text{--} 20,000\,\Msun$ and star particles of mass $\sim 5000 \text{--} 7000\,
\Msun$\footnote{In fact, the simulation m12i contained a gas
splitting bug which causes a small number of gas and star particles to have
larger than typical masses. These constitute only $\sim0.2\%$ of the star
particles in the $z=0$ snapshots, and are only a factor of a few more massive
than typical star particles. Since our results are broadly consistent between
the three simulations, we ignore this minor complication.}, with the lower end
coming from stellar evolution \citep{2018arXiv180610564S}. Softening lengths
for dark matter and star particles are fixed at $112\,\pc$ and $11.2\,\pc$,
respectively.\footnote{This is $2.8$ times the often-quoted
Plummer-equivalent.} The gas softening length is adaptive, but at $z=0$ the
median softening length for gas particles around roughly solar positions (with
cylindrical radii within $500\,\pc$ of $8.2\,\kpc$ and $\abs{z}<1\,\kpc$) is
$98\,\pc$.

In this work, we take the coordinate systems used in
\citet{2018arXiv180610564S} as our fiducial coordinate systems for each
galaxy. The center of the galaxy is found through an iterative ``shrinking
spheres'' method, where the center is calculated for a given radius which is
then reduced by $50\%$ until converging on the galaxy's center. The center of
mass velocity is then determined by all star particles within $15\,\kpc$ of
this center. The galaxy is then rotated onto the principal axis frame as
determined by stars younger than $1\,\Gyr$ inside of the fiducial solar radius
$R_{\odot} = 8.2\,\kpc$.

% We restrict ourselves to the simulation m12i \citep[first introduced
% in][]{2016ApJ...827L..23W}. For this work, this galaxy is the best-case
% scenario. It does not contain a bar (like \texttt{m12m}) or companion galaxy,
% and by eye is the closest to axisymmetric of the three galaxies presented in
% \citet{2018arXiv180610564S} \citep{2018MNRAS.481.4133G}.

It is important to remember that simulations of Milky Way-mass galaxies are
not perfect representations of the true Milky Way, as discussed in
\citet{2018arXiv180610564S}. For instance, the velocity structure of m12i is
closer to M31 than the Milky Way. However, in this work we are most interested
in the global properties of the m12i potential, and specifically in deviations
from axisymmetry. From this perspective, m12i is actually far more
axisymmetric than we might expect of the Milky Way. While m12i has prominent
spiral arms, it lacks a bar and a companion like the Large Magellanic Cloud.
In future work, these additional complications also need to be addressed.

\subsection{Local Midplane} \label{sec:local_midplane}
We now turn to defining the local midplane that an observer might measure if
they were situated in each of these galaxies. We place our imaginary observer
at the solar radius of $8.2\,\kpc$ and azimuth $\phi$, and consider stars
within a cylinder perpendicular to the fiducial disk

For a given azimuth $\phi$ at the solar radius of $8.2\,\kpc$, we take the
median height of all star particles within a cylinder of radius $0.5\,\kpc$
and total height $2\,\kpc$. This median height is taken to be what our
imaginary observer would measure as the local Galactic midplane, and is
reported for each galaxy in Figure~\ref{fig:midplane}. We find that only $10$
iterations of this procedure are necessary for convergence. We bootstrap
resample $1000$ times and report the $95^{\text{th}}$ minus $5^{\text{th}}$
percentile as the dashed-line error bars.

To allow for potential small inaccuracies in the fiducial coordinate systems,
we also subtract the best fit $\text{A} \sin{\phi + \text{B}} + C$ from the
midplane as a function of azimuth. For $\text{A}$, the values are $-165$,
$45$, $9\,\pc$ and for $\text{C}$ the values are $-69$, $19$, and $-18\,\pc$
for m12i, m12f, and m12m, respectively. For the assumed solar radius of
$8.2\,\kpc$, we can approximate the angle offset for the $z$-axis from the
values of $\text{A}$ --- we compute $1.15$, $0.31$, and $0.06\,\deg$ for m12i,
m12f, and m12m. These angle offsets are consistent with the values given in
\citet{2018arXiv180610564S} for the difference between the $z$-axis as defined
by the gas and stars.

Figure~\ref{fig:midplane} shows the inferred midplane our imaginary observer
would make as a function of azimuth for each galaxy. The $90\%$ interquartile
range for each galaxy is $185$, $162$, $84\,\pc$ for m12i, m12f, and m12m.

\end{figure*}

Our analysis makes the assumption that a global midplane is well defined.
However, our results are also consistent with the notion that the global
midplane is not a well-defined concept. Furthermore, none of the galaxies chosen in this work have 

\section{Coordinate System Gone Wrong} \label{sec:ref_frame}
We show and quantify the time evolution of measured actions that comes about
from inaccuracies in the galactocentric coordinate system.

\subsection{Cartoon} \label{ssec:cartoon}
We begin with a cartoon in Figure~\ref{fig:cartoon} to show that an inaccurate determination of 
The solid gray line indicates a hypothetical ``true'' orbit. The y-axis
corresponds to the vertical height of the orbit and the x-axis to either time
or orbital phase. The dashed gray line is an incorrect midplane which an
observer uses to compute orbits.

Now suppose this observer makes a measurement of the true orbit at the orange
point or the red point. Then the orange and red lines correspond to the orbits
that the observer would compute for each point. In action space, this would
correspond to a different value of $J_z$ for the orange and red points. In
this way, assuming the wrong coordinate system induces time dependence in the
actions {\em computed by an observer}.

\begin{figure*}
\plotone{fig/cartoon.pdf}
\caption{Caption.}
\label{fig:cartoon}
\end{figure*}

\subsection{Quantification} \label{ssec:quant}
We now turn to classical orbital integration in a commonly assumed Milky Way
potential to quantify the time variation of computed actions for different
coordinate system errors.

We use the code \texttt{gala} v0.3 to perform orbit integrations and
conversion to action space \citep{2017JOSS....2..388P,Price-Whelan:2018},
which uses an action estimator technique presented by
\citet{2014MNRAS.441.3284S}. We use the default \texttt{MWPotential} as our
potential, which is based on the Milky Way potential available in
\texttt{galpy} \citep{2015ApJS..216...29B}. This potential includes a
Hernquist bulge and nucleus \citep{1990ApJ...356..359H}, a Miyamoto-Nagai disk
\citep{1975PASJ...27..533M}, and an NFW halo \citep{1997ApJ...490..493N}, and
is fit to empirically match some observations. We use the Dormand-Prince
8(5,3) integration scheme \citep{Dormand80:integrator}. We use a timestep of
$1\,\Myr$ and integrate for $5\,\Gyr$, corresponding to $\sim 20$ orbits for
a Sun-like star.

First, we illustrate the time-dependence of one possible inaccurate reference
frame. We begin by taking an orbit with initial position $(8, 0, 0)\,\kpc$ and
initial velocity $(0, -190, 50)\,\kms$ --- this corresponds to an orbit with
actions $(J_r, L_z, J_z) = (32.5, -1520, 23.0)\,\actunit$. The orbit is
plotted in \Gus{Appendix x}. We then suppose that an observer makes
observations of this orbit in a coordinate system that is incorrect in radius by
$200\,\pc$ and height by $100\,\pc$ --- we subtract the vector $(200, 0,
100)\,\pc$ from each position in the orbit. This corresponds to an observer
physically located at the position $(8, 0, 0)\,\kpc$ but erroneously thinking
they are located at $(8.2, 0, 0.1)\,\kpc$.

Using the observations of the orbit that this erroneous observer makes every
$\Myr$, we perform the same orbit integration procedure as before to compute
the actions our observer would make in the incorrect coordinate system over the
duration of the orbit. The erroneous computed actions are shown for the first
$\Gyr$ of the orbit in Figure~\ref{fig:one_orbit_wrong_ref}. Occasionally the
numerical scheme fails and very large actions are reported by \texttt{gala}
--- we perform a $5\sigma$ clip on each action to exclude such orbits, but
this only excludes a total of $5$ orbits out of the $1000$ considered for
Figure~\ref{fig:one_orbit_wrong_ref}. Some numerical artifacts remain, but the
vast majority of orbits are computed properly.

Figure~\ref{fig:one_orbit_wrong_ref} shows that the erroneous observer would
infer significant time evolution in their computed actions. The
95\textsuperscript{th} minus 5\textsuperscript{th} percentiles are $8.7$,
$47.1$, and $19.3\,\actunit$ for $J_r$, $L_z$, and $J_z$, respectively. These
are fractional errors of $26.5\%$, $3.1\%$, and $81.4\%$, respectively.

\section{Optimally Axisymmetric Frame} \label{sec:oa_frame}
An analytic, axisymmetric potential with a known coordinate system is a far
too simple description of the Milky Way. We thus turn to cosmological zoom-in
simulations as approximations to a ``true'' Milky Way potential. We will
perform a few simulations of small clusters embedded in the potential of a
frozen $\z=0$ snapshot of one such zoom-in. We take our fiducial reference
frame from \citet{2018arXiv180610564S}.

Freezing the potential means that during the course of our simulation the
cluster will rapidly pass by much of the substructure in the potential. To
illustrate that this has little effect on our results, we resimulate each
cluster with the softening lengths of the embedded potential increased by a
factor of \Gus{something}.

Once we perform this simulation, we calculate the actions of each star in the
cluster assuming the best-fit smooth, axisymmetric potential, as we do
observationally for the Milky Way. We refer to this space as the observational
action space. We will find that there is significant time evolution in
observational action space. Attributing some of this evolution to our fiducial
coordinate system being incorrect, we minimize the time-dispersion in action
space

\subsection{Cluster Simulations} \label{ssec:cluster_sim}
We simulate a small star cluster of $256$ stars in the frozen $\z=0$
potential of m12i. We use the code \texttt{ph4} within the
\texttt{AMUSE} framework \citep{2011ascl.soft07007P, 2013CoPhC.184..456P,
2013A&A...557A..84P} for the cluster integration. We use a softening length
of $0.01\,\pc$ which means we do not correctly solve the internal dynamics of
the cluster, but this is not important for our purposes. To couple the
gravitational forces of the frozen snapshot to the cluster stars, we use the
\texttt{BRIDGE} \citep{2007PASJ...59.1095F}, also implemented in
\texttt{AMUSE}. Our simulation runs for $2\,\Gyr$, allowing us to solve for
$\sim 10$ orbits.

To compute the forces from the frozen potential, we use the simple tree code
\texttt{pykdgrav}\footnote{\url{https://github.com/omgspace/pykdgrav},
commit: \texttt{fbd1ddc}}. We use an opening angle of $0.5$ and exclude stars
at distances $R>50\,\kpc$ in the fiducial coordinate system.

We use the initial position and velocity of two star particles in
m12i. These two star particles are randomly chosen from all star
particles in the simulation with the following properties (in the fiducial
coordinate system):
\begin{enumerate}
    \item age in the range $(0.25, 0.75)\,\Gyr$,
    \item cylindrical radius in the range $(7.7, 8.7)\,\kpc$,
    \item height (absolute value) less than $0.5\,\kpc$,
    \item $J_r$ and $J_z$ in the range:
        \subitem $(10, 20)\,\actunit$ for the first star,
        \subitem $(40, 60)\,\actunit$ for the second star.
\end{enumerate}
The ids we choose are \texttt{23693026} for the first star and
\texttt{17012804} for the second star. We refrain from calling these ``low''
or ``high'' action stars since the actions are computed in a presumably
incorrect coordinate system.

To compute actions, both in the choosing of each of these star particles and
in what follows, we use the package
\texttt{agama}\footnote{\url{https://github.com/GalacticDynamics-Oxford/Agama},
commit: \texttt{0e48336}}. Using only the high-resolution particles, we
compute the symmetrized potential in two components. First, a multipole
expansion with $20$ radial grid points and a max order of $2$ for the
spherical-harmonic expansion is used for the dark matter. Second, a
cylindrical spline expansion with $20$ radial and $z$ grid points, a $0$ order
max index azimuthal-harmonic expansion, $0.2$ and $50\,\kpc$ for the minimum
and maximum radial grid node, $0.02$ and $10\,\kpc$ for the minimum and
maximum $z$ grid node is used for the baryonic matter (stars and gas). In both
cases, axisymmetry is explicitly enforced. Other \texttt{agama} parameters are
left as default.

\subsection{Frame Optimization} \label{ssec:frame_opt}
Figure~\Gus{something} shows the action computed at each time step in the
fiducial coordinate system. Clearly there is significant time evolution.

Even though we change the center, we do not recalculate the center velocity.
This is largely irrelevant, as the recalculated center velocity differs from
the fiducial center velocity by $<0.1\,\kms$. In recentering the galaxy, the
package \texttt{gizmo\_analysis} will subtract a slightly different value for
the Hubble flow from each particle's velocity to convert to a physical
coordinate system. The error this introduces is $\sim 0.02\,\kms$, which we
also ignore.
