\begin{abstract}

In a completely axisymmetric potential, the notion of a global Galactic
midplane is well defined. However, since the Milky Way is not completely
axisymmetric, the global Galactic midplane is to some level of precision not
well defined. The local Galactic midplane has been found by determining the
height at which the number counts of stars reaches a maximum. This local
midplane is then used as the global midplane, an assumption which would be
justified in a completely axisymmetric potential. Assuming a global Galactic
midplane exists, we show in three cosmological zoom-in simulations from the
FIRE collaboration that local determinations of the midplane can vary by up to
a thin disk scale height. The effect is more pronounced in galaxies with less
quiescent histories (e.g. Sagittarius-like encounters). We explore one
consequence of such an inaccuracy of the midplane in the context of orbital
actions. Using standard orbit integration techniques, we show that midplane
inaccuracy induces artifical time evolution in the vertical action that makes
it virtually unusable for individual stars in the disk. The situation is less
dire for angular momentum and radial action determinations, though we also
show that inaccuracies in the solar radius can have a similar effect on the
latter. As a result, we question the use of actions as dynamical invariants in
the Milky Way disk.

\section{Introduction} \label{sec:intro}
Our understanding of the Milky Way is currently undergoing a revolution in the
era of {\em Gaia} DR2. Recent major discoveries include the remnants of a
major merger \citep{2018Natur.563...85H}, a phase-space spiral (\Gus{cites})
indicating local substructure infall (\Gus{cites}), a gap indicative of a dark
matter subtructure in GD1 \citep{2018arXiv181103631B}, and \Gus{others}.

Underlying all of these discoveries is the assumption of a galactocentric
coordinate system \citep{2008gady.book.....B}. In angular
coordinates, the center of the galaxy is taken to be the location of
Sgr~A\textsuperscript{*} \citep[e.g.][]{2004ApJ...616..872R}. From stellar
motions near Sgr~A\textsuperscript{*}, the distance to the center is taken to
be $\sim 8.1\text{--}8.3\,\kpc$
\citep{2009ApJ...692.1075G,2018A&A...615L..15G}. The vertical height is found
by identifying where the stellar positions and velocities reach a maximum
(effectively the median height of all disk stars), and is usually taken to be
$\sim 25\,\pc$ \citep{2001ApJ...553..184C}, with more recent measurements from
{\em Gaia} DR2 placing it at $\sim 20\,\pc$ \citep{2019MNRAS.482.1417B}.

These measurements of the galactocentric coordinate system rely on the
assumption of an axisymmetric Milky Way. Under this assumption, these
estimates would provide the correct parameters for the galactocentric
coordinate system up to measurement error. However, the Milky Way is not
axisymmetric in detail. Spiral arms, bar(s), and infalling satellite galaxies
such as Sagittarius and the Large Magellanic Cloud all induce
non-axisymmetries.

Since the Milky Way is not truly axisymmetric, it is not clear the best way to
define the galactocentric coordinate system. In this work, we consider one
possible physically motivated approach to defining the galactocentric
coordinate system, and show that it can differ from conventional methods of
frame measurements.

In a slowly-evolving axisymmetric potential, the actions of stars' orbits are
conserved quantities \citep{2008gady.book.....B,2014RvMP...86....1S}. In other
words, if we could measure the actions of a star in such a potential, we would
measure the same actions over the course of the orbit. The non-axisymmetries
of a more realistic potential induce time evolution in the {\em measured}
actions --- the true orbital invariants (if they exist) are invariant by
definition. Through simple tests, we will see that even in a truly
axisymmetric potential, if the wrong coordinate system is assumed then there
will be additional time evolution in the measured actions.

To provide one such realization of a realistic Galactic potential, we turn to
cosmological zoom-ins of Milky Way-mass galaxies from the Feedback in
Realistic Environments (FIRE)
collaboration\footnote{\url{https://fire.northwestern.edu}} (the Latte suite
of simulations).

\section{Local Midplane in FIRE} \label{sec:local_fire}
\subsection{Description of Simulation} \label{ssec:cosmozoom}
Here we briefly describe the cosmological zoom-ins used in this work.
Cosmological zoom-ins allow one to simulate a selected region at high
resolution embedded in a low-resolution cosmological background
\citep[e.g.][]{1993ApJ...412..455K,2014MNRAS.437.1894O}. The FIRE
collaboration has simulated a number of Milky Way-mass zoom-ins as part of the
{\em Latte} suite of FIRE-2 simulations
\citep{2016ApJ...827L..23W,2018MNRAS.481.4133G}. We use the three zoom-ins
considered in \citet{2018arXiv180610564S} --- m12i, m12f, m12m, since they
have associated mock {\em Gaia} DR2 catalogues and the $z=0$ snapshots are
publicly available.

First, a dark matter only simulation was run with $\Lambda$CDM cosmology
parameterized by $\Omega_m = 0.272$, $\Omega_{\Lambda} = 0.728$, $\Omega_b =
0.0455$, $h = 0.702$, $\sigma_8 = 0.807$, and $n_s = 0.961$, consistent with
current constraints \citep{2018arXiv180706209P}. Halos are selected at $z=0$
based solely on their mass ($\sim 1\text{--}2 \times 10^{12} \Msun$).
Particles within $5 R_{200\text{m}}$ of each halo are traced back to $\z=99$
and the initial conditions are regenerated at higher resolution using MUSIC
\citep{2011MNRAS.415.2101H}.

Simulations were run using
\texttt{GIZMO}\footnote{\url{http://www.tapir.caltech.edu/~phopkins/Site/GIZMO.html}}
\citep{2015MNRAS.450...53H}. Hydrodynamics is solved using the meshless
finite-mass method and gravity is solved using a modified version of the
Tree-PM solver of \texttt{GADGET-3}, using fully adaptive and fully
conservative gravitational force softening for gas.

These halos are uncontaminated and contain gas particles of mass $\sim 7000
\text{--} 20,000\,\Msun$ and star particles of mass $\sim 5000 \text{--} 7000\,
\Msun$\footnote{In fact, the simulation m12i contained a gas
splitting bug which causes a small number of gas and star particles to have
larger than typical masses. These constitute only $\sim0.2\%$ of the star
particles in the $z=0$ snapshots, and are only a factor of a few more massive
than typical star particles. Since our results are broadly consistent between
the three simulations, we ignore this minor complication.}, with the lower end
coming from stellar evolution \citep{2018arXiv180610564S}. Softening lengths
for dark matter and star particles are fixed at $112\,\pc$ and $11.2\,\pc$,
respectively.\footnote{This is $2.8$ times the often-quoted
Plummer-equivalent.} The gas softening length is adaptive, but at $z=0$ the
median softening length for gas particles around roughly solar positions (with
cylindrical radii within $500\,\pc$ of $8.2\,\kpc$ and $\abs{z}<1\,\kpc$) is
$98\,\pc$.

In this work, we take the coordinate systems used in
\citet{2018arXiv180610564S} as our fiducial coordinate systems for each
galaxy. The center of the galaxy is found through an iterative ``shrinking
spheres'' method, where the center is calculated for a given radius which is
then reduced by $50\%$ until converging on the galaxy's center. The center of
mass velocity is then determined by all star particles within $15\,\kpc$ of
this center. The galaxy is then rotated onto the principal axis frame as
determined by stars younger than $1\,\Gyr$ inside of the fiducial solar radius
$R_{\odot} = 8.2\,\kpc$.

% We restrict ourselves to the simulation m12i \citep[first introduced
% in][]{2016ApJ...827L..23W}. For this work, this galaxy is the best-case
% scenario. It does not contain a bar (like \texttt{m12m}) or companion galaxy,
% and by eye is the closest to axisymmetric of the three galaxies presented in
% \citet{2018arXiv180610564S} \citep{2018MNRAS.481.4133G}.

It is important to remember that simulations of Milky Way-mass galaxies are
not perfect representations of the true Milky Way, as discussed in
\citet{2018arXiv180610564S}. For instance, the velocity structure of m12i is
closer to M31 than the Milky Way. However, in this work we are most interested
in the global properties of the m12i potential, and specifically in deviations
from axisymmetry. From this perspective, m12i is actually far more
axisymmetric than we might expect of the Milky Way. While m12i has prominent
spiral arms, it lacks a bar and a companion like the Large Magellanic Cloud.
In future work, these additional complications also need to be addressed.

\subsection{Local Midplane} \label{sec:local_midplane}
We now turn to defining the local midplane that an observer might measure if
they were situated in each of these galaxies. We place our imaginary observer
at the solar radius of $8.2\,\kpc$ and azimuth $\phi$, and consider stars
within a cylinder perpendicular to the fiducial disk

For a given azimuth $\phi$ at the solar radius of $8.2\,\kpc$, we take the
median height of all star particles within a cylinder of radius $0.5\,\kpc$
and total height $2\,\kpc$. This median height is taken to be what our
imaginary observer would measure as the local Galactic midplane, and is
reported for each galaxy in Figure~\ref{fig:midplane}. We find that only $10$
iterations of this procedure are necessary for convergence. We bootstrap
resample $1000$ times and report the $95^{\text{th}}$ minus $5^{\text{th}}$
percentile as the dashed-line error bars.

To allow for potential small inaccuracies in the fiducial coordinate systems,
we also subtract the best fit $\text{A} \sin{\phi + \text{B}} + C$ from the
midplane as a function of azimuth. For $\text{A}$, the values are $-165$,
$45$, $9\,\pc$ and for $\text{C}$ the values are $-69$, $19$, and $-18\,\pc$
for m12i, m12f, and m12m, respectively. For the assumed solar radius of
$8.2\,\kpc$, we can approximate the angle offset for the $z$-axis from the
values of $\text{A}$ --- we compute $1.15$, $0.31$, and $0.06\,\deg$ for m12i,
m12f, and m12m. These angle offsets are consistent with the values given in
\citet{2018arXiv180610564S} for the difference between the $z$-axis as defined
by the gas and stars.

Figure~\ref{fig:midplane} shows the inferred midplane our imaginary observer
would make as a function of azimuth for each galaxy. The $90\%$ interquartile
range for each galaxy is $185$, $162$, $84\,\pc$ for m12i, m12f, and m12m. 

\begin{figure*}
\plotone{fig/midplane_fit.pdf}
\caption{Caption.}
\label{fig:midplane}
\end{figure*}

Our analysis makes the assumption that a global midplane is well defined.
However, our results are also consistent with the notion that the global
midplane is not a well-defined concept.

\subsection{Dynamical Midplane}
We now seek to define the midplane in a dynamically consistent manner, which
we refer to as the ``dynamical midplane''. By this, we mean we would like to
define the midplane in a manner consistent with some sort of dynamical
constraint. Our method, which we describe now, is just one of many possible
ways the dynamical midplane can be defined.

We define the dynamical midplane based on the principle that perfectly
circular, planar orbits will trace the midplane. Once the circular, planar
orbits have been identified, the procedure for finding the dynamical midplane
is relatively simple. From the measurement of each star's orbit, the midplane
of the galaxy can be computed at $z=0$ easily. Furthermore, we will find that
each orbit also gives a measure of the: dynamical center of the galaxy,
velocity of the galaxy, and acceleration of the galaxy.

We pause briefly to consider general difficulties in measuring stellar orbits
in a cosmological simulation. It may seem reasonable to place the galaxy in an
inertial reference frame and then to simply measure the positions of each star
particle over time. However, it is not generally the case that the center of
mass of the stellar disk experiences a vanishing acceleration. Indeed, in a
re-run of the simulations presented here\footnote{The re-run contained a
cosmic ray bug fix which is unimportant here, but the re-run also output the
acceleration of each particle, which is not the case for the simulations in
this work.}, we measure a total acceleration of $\sim 0.4\,\kms/\text{Myr}$
for stars with cylindrical radii within $0.5\,\kpc$ of $8.2\,\kpc$ and
vertical heights less than $0.4\,\kpc$. Assuming a constant acceleration, over
$22\,\Myr$ --- the time spacing of snapshots considered in this work --- this
results in a $\sim90\,\pc$ shift of the disk. Since the offset scales with
$t^2$, this presents a significant problem for measuring stellar orbits over
longer timescales.

Another option is to recenter and reorient the galaxy at each snapshot.
However, the centering and orientation procedures are not without
stochasticity themselves. This stochasticity can easily dominate the magnitude
of the orbit. For instance, a shift in the direction of the $z$-axis by a mere
$0.7\degree$ results in a shift in the midplane of $100\,\pc$ at a radius of
$8.2\,\kpc$. We attempted this procedure in various ways (i.e. exploring
different centering and orientation procedures), but were not able to cleanly
measure the orbits of disk stars.

Here we choose to simplify the problem by considering only perfectly circular,
planar orbits. Since these orbits have no phase-dependent structure, we can
work on shorter timescales, i.e. for orbits with significant radial or
vertical action a large fraction of their orbit would need to be sampled in
order to measure the orbit accurately. Because we know the analytic form of
these orbits, we can forward model the trajectory of each star particle in the
cosmological simulation. Working in comoving coordinates, we can write down
the trajectory of a star particle as
\beq\label{eq:helix}
\bm{r}(t) = R(\theta, \phi, \psi) \left[ (A\cos{\omega t}, B\sin{\omega t}, C
t) + \bm{x_0} \right]\text{,}
\eeq
where $R(\theta, \phi, \psi)$ is an Euler angle transformation, $A$, $B$, $C$,
and $\omega$ are arbitrary constants, and $\bm{x_0}$ is an arbitrary 3-vector.
This equation is a helix with an arbitrary constant and rotation. It describes
the

We minimize the summed squared difference between Equation~\ref{eq:helix} and
the true trajectory of each star with $R$ within $1\,\kpc$ of $R_{\odot} =
8.2\,\kpc$ in each simulation. We consider minimum rms error (i.e. the typical
error in the Equation~\ref{eq:helix} model in describing the true trajectory).
This rms error characterizes how well the helix model we consider, which would
be exactly correct if the overall motion of the galaxy is well-described by
constant speed motion and the orbit of a particular store is exactly circular
and planar.

We plot a histogram of the rms error for each galaxy in
Figure~\ref{fig:something}. As we estimated before, the total effect of the
galaxy's acceleration is roughly $90\,\pc$ (\Gus{Check for m12f, m12m}). We
find that this is small compared to the typical error, even for the stars
whose trajectories are best modeled by Equation~\ref{eq:helix}.

There are many reasons for the failure of this model. First, there could be no
stars on circular orbits. This seems unlikely considering that typical
distribution functions peak on perfectly circular, planar orbits
\citep[e.g.][]{2013MNRAS.434..652T}. Second, the trajectory of the galaxy may
not be well-described by constant-speed motion. This also seems unlikely,
considering that the bulk acceleration of the stellar disk only results in a
$\sim90\,\pc$ (\Gus{m12f, m12m}) deviation from constant-speed motion over the
$22\,\Myr$ time we considered.

Furthermore, in Figure~\ref{fig:something} we plot the center of mass of the
galaxy (in comoving coordinates) for the $22\,\Myr$ timeframe described. The
center of mass at each snapshot is computed using the iterative shrinking
spheres method described in Section~\ref{ssec:cosmozoom}. The rms error on the
constant-speed motion is $\sim\text{something}$, which we interpret as
\Gus{something}.

One potential explanation is that {\em no star can remain on a circular,
planar orbit}. The order unity density variations may be strong enough such
that each star's orbit is perturbed. If there are truly stars in the
simulation on perfectly circular, planar orbits, then the magnitude of their
acceleration over the last $22\,\Myr$ must be constant. Furthermore, their
trajectory in acceleration space must be well-described by a rotation. In the re-runs, 

\section{Coordinate System Gone Wrong} \label{sec:ref_frame}
We show and quantify the time evolution of measured actions that comes about
from inaccuracies in the galactocentric coordinate system.

\subsection{Cartoon} \label{ssec:cartoon}
We begin with a cartoon in Figure~\ref{fig:cartoon} to show that an inaccurate
determination of The solid gray line indicates a hypothetical ``true'' orbit.
The y-axis corresponds to the vertical height of the orbit and the x-axis to
either time or orbital phase. The dashed gray line is an incorrect midplane
which an observer uses to compute orbits.

Now suppose this observer makes a measurement of the true orbit at the orange
point or the red point. Then the orange and red lines correspond to the orbits
that the observer would compute for each point. In action space, this would
correspond to a different value of $J_z$ for the orange and red points. In
this way, assuming the wrong coordinate system induces time dependence in the
actions {\em computed by an observer}.

\begin{figure*}
\plotone{fig/cartoon.pdf}
\caption{Caption.}
\label{fig:cartoon}
\end{figure*}

\subsection{Quantification} \label{ssec:quant}
We now turn to classical orbital integration in a commonly assumed Milky Way
potential to quantify the time variation of computed actions for different
coordinate system errors.

We use the code \texttt{gala} v0.3 to perform orbit integrations and
conversion to action space \citep{2017JOSS....2..388P,Price-Whelan:2018},
which uses an action estimator technique presented by
\citet{2014MNRAS.441.3284S}. We use the default \texttt{MWPotential} as our
potential, which is based on the Milky Way potential available in
\texttt{galpy} \citep{2015ApJS..216...29B}. This potential includes a
Hernquist bulge and nucleus \citep{1990ApJ...356..359H}, a Miyamoto-Nagai disk
\citep{1975PASJ...27..533M}, and an NFW halo \citep{1997ApJ...490..493N}, and
is fit to empirically match some observations. We use the Dormand-Prince
8(5,3) integration scheme \citep{Dormand80:integrator}. We use a timestep of
$1\,\Myr$ and integrate for $5\,\Gyr$, corresponding to $\sim 20$ orbits for
a Sun-like star.

First, we illustrate the time-dependence of one possible inaccurate reference
frame. We begin by taking an orbit with initial position $(8, 0, 0)\,\kpc$ and
initial velocity $(0, -190, 50)\,\kms$ --- this corresponds to an orbit with
actions $(J_r, L_z, J_z) = (32.5, -1520, 23.0)\,\actunit$. The orbit is
plotted in \Gus{Appendix x}. We then suppose that an observer makes
observations of this orbit in a coordinate system that is incorrect in radius by
$200\,\pc$ and height by $100\,\pc$ --- we subtract the vector $(200, 0,
100)\,\pc$ from each position in the orbit. This corresponds to an observer
physically located at the position $(8, 0, 0)\,\kpc$ but erroneously thinking
they are located at $(8.2, 0, 0.1)\,\kpc$.

Using the observations of the orbit that this erroneous observer makes every
$\Myr$, we perform the same orbit integration procedure as before to compute
the actions our observer would make in the incorrect coordinate system over the
duration of the orbit. The erroneous computed actions are shown for the first
$\Gyr$ of the orbit in Figure~\ref{fig:one_orbit_wrong_ref}. Occasionally the
numerical scheme fails and very large actions are reported by \texttt{gala}
--- we perform a $5\sigma$ clip on each action to exclude such orbits, but
this only excludes a total of $5$ orbits out of the $1000$ considered for
Figure~\ref{fig:one_orbit_wrong_ref}. Some numerical artifacts remain, but the
vast majority of orbits are computed properly.

Figure~\ref{fig:one_orbit_wrong_ref} shows that the erroneous observer would
infer significant time evolution in their computed actions. The
95\textsuperscript{th} minus 5\textsuperscript{th} percentiles are $8.7$,
$47.1$, and $19.3\,\actunit$ for $J_r$, $L_z$, and $J_z$, respectively. These
are fractional errors of $26.5\%$, $3.1\%$, and $81.4\%$, respectively.

% \section{Optimally Axisymmetric Frame} \label{sec:oa_frame}
% An analytic, axisymmetric potential with a known coordinate system is a far
% too simple description of the Milky Way. We thus turn to cosmological zoom-in
% simulations as approximations to a ``true'' Milky Way potential. We will
% perform a few simulations of small clusters embedded in the potential of a
% frozen $\z=0$ snapshot of one such zoom-in. We take our fiducial reference
% frame from \citet{2018arXiv180610564S}.

% Freezing the potential means that during the course of our simulation the
% cluster will rapidly pass by much of the substructure in the potential. To
% illustrate that this has little effect on our results, we resimulate each
% cluster with the softening lengths of the embedded potential increased by a
% factor of \Gus{something}.

% Once we perform this simulation, we calculate the actions of each star in the
% cluster assuming the best-fit smooth, axisymmetric potential, as we do
% observationally for the Milky Way. We refer to this space as the observational
% action space. We will find that there is significant time evolution in
% observational action space. Attributing some of this evolution to our fiducial
% coordinate system being incorrect, we minimize the time-dispersion in action
% space

% \subsection{Cluster Simulations} \label{ssec:cluster_sim}
% We simulate a small star cluster of $256$ stars in the frozen $\z=0$
% potential of m12i. We use the code \texttt{ph4} within the
% \texttt{AMUSE} framework \citep{2011ascl.soft07007P, 2013CoPhC.184..456P,
% 2013A&A...557A..84P} for the cluster integration. We use a softening length
% of $0.01\,\pc$ which means we do not correctly solve the internal dynamics of
% the cluster, but this is not important for our purposes. To couple the
% gravitational forces of the frozen snapshot to the cluster stars, we use the
% \texttt{BRIDGE} \citep{2007PASJ...59.1095F}, also implemented in
% \texttt{AMUSE}. Our simulation runs for $2\,\Gyr$, allowing us to solve for
% $\sim 10$ orbits.

% To compute the forces from the frozen potential, we use the simple tree code
% \texttt{pykdgrav}\footnote{\url{https://github.com/omgspace/pykdgrav},
% commit: \texttt{fbd1ddc}}. We use an opening angle of $0.5$ and exclude stars
% at distances $R>50\,\kpc$ in the fiducial coordinate system.

% We use the initial position and velocity of two star particles in
% m12i. These two star particles are randomly chosen from all star
% particles in the simulation with the following properties (in the fiducial
% coordinate system):
% \begin{enumerate}
%     \item age in the range $(0.25, 0.75)\,\Gyr$,
%     \item cylindrical radius in the range $(7.7, 8.7)\,\kpc$,
%     \item height (absolute value) less than $0.5\,\kpc$,
%     \item $J_r$ and $J_z$ in the range:
%         \subitem $(10, 20)\,\actunit$ for the first star,
%         \subitem $(40, 60)\,\actunit$ for the second star.
% \end{enumerate}
% The ids we choose are \texttt{23693026} for the first star and
% \texttt{17012804} for the second star. We refrain from calling these ``low''
% or ``high'' action stars since the actions are computed in a presumably
% incorrect coordinate system.

% To compute actions, both in the choosing of each of these star particles and
% in what follows, we use the package
% \texttt{agama}\footnote{\url{https://github.com/GalacticDynamics-Oxford/Agama},
% commit: \texttt{0e48336}}. Using only the high-resolution particles, we
% compute the symmetrized potential in two components. First, a multipole
% expansion with $20$ radial grid points and a max order of $2$ for the
% spherical-harmonic expansion is used for the dark matter. Second, a
% cylindrical spline expansion with $20$ radial and $z$ grid points, a $0$ order
% max index azimuthal-harmonic expansion, $0.2$ and $50\,\kpc$ for the minimum
% and maximum radial grid node, $0.02$ and $10\,\kpc$ for the minimum and
% maximum $z$ grid node is used for the baryonic matter (stars and gas). In both
% cases, axisymmetry is explicitly enforced. Other \texttt{agama} parameters are
% left as default.

% \subsection{Frame Optimization} \label{ssec:frame_opt}
% Figure~\Gus{something} shows the action computed at each time step in the
% fiducial coordinate system. Clearly there is significant time evolution.

% Even though we change the center, we do not recalculate the center velocity.
% This is largely irrelevant, as the recalculated center velocity differs from
% the fiducial center velocity by $<0.1\,\kms$. In recentering the galaxy, the
% package \texttt{gizmo\_analysis} will subtract a slightly different value for
% the Hubble flow from each particle's velocity to convert to a physical
% coordinate system. The error this introduces is $\sim 0.02\,\kms$, which we
% also ignore.
