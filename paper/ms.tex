In an axisymmetric potential the 6D phase space of stars' positions and
velocities can be reduced to a 3D space of invariant actions. We show that if
one assumes the wrong galactocentric reference frame this can induce
artificial non-axisymmetries which manifest as time dependence in the
computed actions. However, the Milky Way is not axisymmetric in detail and so
there are no truly axisymmetric axes. We instead define the  ``optimally
axisymmetric'' axes as the reference frame which minimizes the time
dependence of the computed actions. Standard methods for determining the
galactocentric reference frame typically involve finding the median height of
stars in the disk. Using cosmological zoom-in simulations from FIRE-2, we
show that the optimally axisymmetric reference frame can differ from standard
methods of calculating the galactocentric reference frame by nearly a scale
height. This work calls into question the use of actions as dynamical
invariants unless these reference frame issues can be resolved.

% However, it is not expected that actions are invariant in detail for the
% Milky Way. This in-invariance can come about from assuming the wrong
% Galactic potential, but it can also come about due to true
% non-axisymmetries. We show that actions can gain artificial time-dependence
% also by assuming the wrong reference frame. We argue that standard methods
% for determining the galactocentric reference frame are not gu

% it's spiral arms, bar(s), and gas clouds are all non-axisymmetric features

% potential when computing actions, this will induce an artificial short-term
% phase dependence of the actions, which we interpret as systematic error.
% Using the potential of cosmological zoom-in simulations of Milky Way mass

\section{Introduction} \label{sec:intro}
Our understanding of the Milky Way is currently undergoing a revolution in the era of \gdr. Recent major discoveries include the remnants of a major merger \citep{2018Natur.563...85H}, a phase-space spiral (\Gus{cites}) indicating local substructure infall (\Gus{cites}), a gap indicative of a dark matter subtructure in GD1 \citep{2018arXiv181103631B}, and \Gus{others}. 

\section{Reference Frame Gone Wrong} \label{sec:ref_frame}
We begin by quantifying how 

\section{Optimally Axisymmetric Frame} \label{sec:oa_frame}
An analytic, axisymmetric potential with a known reference frame is a far too
simple description of the Milky Way. We thus turn to cosmological zoom-in
simulations as approximations to a ``true'' Milky Way potential. We will
perform a few simulations of small clusters embedded in the potential of a
frozen $\z=0$ snapshot of one such zoom-in. We take our fiducial reference
frame from \citet{2018arXiv180610564S}.

Freezing the potential means that during the course of our simulation the
cluster will rapidly pass by much of the substructure in the potential. To
illustrate that this has little effect on our results, we resimulate each
cluster with the softening lengths of the embedded potential increased by a
factor of \Gus{something}.

Once we perform this simulation, we calculate the actions of each star in the
cluster assuming the best-fit smooth, axisymmetric potential, as we do
observationally for the Milky Way. We refer to this space as the observational action space. We will find that there is significant time evolution in observational action space. Attributing some of this evolution to our fiducial reference frame being incorrect, we minimize the time-dispersion in action space 

\subsection{Cosmological Zoom-in} \label{ssec:cosmozoom}
Cosmological zoom-ins allow one to simulate a selected region at high
resolution embedded in a low-resolution cosmological background
\citep[e.g.][]{1993ApJ...412..455K,2014MNRAS.437.1894O}. Here we use a
zoom-in of a Milky Way-mass galaxy from the FIRE-2 collaboration.

First, a dark matter only simulation was run with $\Lambda$CDM cosmology
parameterized by $\Omega_m = 0.272$, $\Omega_{\Lambda} = 0.728$, $\Omega_b =
0.0455$, $h = 0.702$, $\sigma_8 = 0.807$, and $n_s = 0.961$, consistent with
current constraints \citep{2018arXiv180706209P}. Halos are selected at $z=0$
based solely on their mass ($\sim 1\text{--}2 \times 10^{12} \Msun$).
Particles within $5 R_{200\text{m}}$ of each halo are traced back to $\z=99$
and the initial conditions are regenerated at higher resolution using MUSIC
\citep{2011MNRAS.415.2101H}. A total of $\sim 10$ halos were simulated at
higher resolution \citep{2018MNRAS.481.4133G}.

These halos are uncontaminated and contain gas particles of mass $\sim 7000
\text{--} 20,000\,\Msun$ and star particles of mass $\sim 5000 \text{--} 7000\,
\Msun$, with the lower end coming from stellar evolution
\citep{2018arXiv180610564S}. Softening lengths for dark matter and star
particles are fixed at $112\,\pc$ and $11.2\,\pc$,
respectively.\footnote{This is $2.8$ times the often-quoted
Plummer-equivalent.} The gas softening length is adaptive, but at $z=0$ the
median softening length for gas particles around roughly solar positions
(with cylindrical radii within $500\,\pc$ of $8.2\,\kpc$ and
$\abs{z}<1\,\kpc$) is $98\,\pc$.

We restrict ourselves to the simulation \texttt{m12i} \citep[first introduced
in][]{2016ApJ...827L..23W}. For this work, this galaxy is the best-case
scenario. It does not contain a bar (like \texttt{m12m}) or companion galaxy,
and by eye is the closest to axisymmetric of the three galaxies presented in
\citet{2018arXiv180610564S} \citep{2018MNRAS.481.4133G}.

It is important to remember that simulations of Milky Way-mass galaxies are
not perfect representations of the true Milky Way, as discussed in
\citet{2018arXiv180610564S}. For instance, the velocity structure of
\texttt{m12i} is closer to M31 than the Milky Way. However, in this work we
are most interested in the global properties of the \texttt{m12i} potential,
and specifically in deviations from axisymmetry. From this perspective,
\texttt{m12i} is actually far more axisymmetric than we might expect of the
Milky Way. While \texttt{m12i} has prominent spiral arms, it lacks a bar and
a companion like the Large Magellanic Cloud. In future work, these additional
complications also need to be addressed.

\subsection{Cluster Simulations} \label{ssec:cluster_sim}
We simulate a small star cluster of $256$ stars in the frozen $\z=0$
potential of $\texttt{m12i}$. We use the code \texttt{ph4} within the
\texttt{AMUSE} framework \citep{2011ascl.soft07007P, 2013CoPhC.184..456P,
2013A&A...557A..84P} for the cluster integration. We use a softening length
of $0.01\,\pc$ which means we do not correctly solve the internal dynamics of
the cluster, but this is not important for our purposes. To couple the
gravitational forces of the frozen snapshot to the cluster stars, we use the
\texttt{BRIDGE} \citep{2007PASJ...59.1095F}, also implemented in
\texttt{AMUSE}. Our simulation runs for $2\,\Gyr$, allowing us to solve for
$\sim 10$ orbits.

To compute the forces from the frozen potential, we use the simple tree code
\texttt{pykdgrav}\footnote{\url{https://github.com/omgspace/pykdgrav},
commit:\texttt{fbd1ddc}}. 

We use the initial position and velocity of two star particles in
$\texttt{m12i}$

Even though we change the center, we do not recalculate the center velocity.
This is largely irrelevant, as the recalculated center velocity differs from
the fiducial center velocity by $<0.1\,\kms$.
